# bookbot
Bookbot project test on git using VScode

Bookbot has the hability to:
1. How many words a text contains
2. How many times was a character used
3. Print a report of how many times a letter was used

Besides reinforcing dictionary comprehensions what I learned on this python project was:
- Reading files 
- Methods such as split and sort
- Report printing
- sorting a dict after turning it into a list

I would still like to work on the next points on this project:

1. Sorting the report alphabetically
2. removing the keys from the report items
